    "The concept behind neural states is to define the state of a neural network at a given time.\n",
    "This could theoretically take any form and the recorders allow for the definition of custom states.\n",
    "However, the default state can take the following form:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "neural_state = {\n",
    "    \"loss\": np.ndarray, \n",
    "    \"accuracy\": np.ndarray,\n",
    "    \"predictions\": np.ndarray,\n",
    "    \"targets\": np.ndarray,\n",
    "    \"ntk\": np.ndarray,\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that this defines one neural state.\n",
    "The keys of the dictionary have to match the keys of the `Measurement` objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each value of a neural state has to be a numpy array, with its first dimension defining \n",
    "the number of sub-states, the entire neural state is composed of.\n",
    "For all keys, the number of sub-states has to be the same."
